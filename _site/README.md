## What is A11yGoat
This is a site that has been made purposely inaccessible as a way to teach people about accessibility.

### A11y?
A11y is a *numeronym*! Cool word, right? It is a tag used for web accessibility in the same way i18n is for internationalization and l10n is localization. It's taking the first and last letters and telling you how many letters are in between. **a + (ccessibilit == 10) + y**

### Goat?
This I'm borrowing from another project WebGoat, which is an open source project that provides a purposely **insecure** site to help teach web security. The "goat", as they explain,  comes from the word scapegoat. They're intention is that "developers should not feel bad about knowing _______" ... "so blame it on the 'goat." I don't think I fully understand that sentiment, but since the inspiration came from WebGoat, A11yGoat made sense.


## How to Run
While you can view it freely on the [github public site](http://jazahn.github.io/A11yGoat/), the intention is for developers to download the code so you can get into the inaccessible files and make changes. There is no need for a backend language, however, it's not going to run *well* if it's just run from a *file://* so I would recommend something like [Python's SimpleHTTPServer](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/) or [npm's http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

## How to Contribute
* As an accesisbility professional

  Please feel free to browse the [public site](http://jazahn.github.io/A11yGoat/) and if you have suggestions or can think of things to add, add them via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jazahn/A11yGoat/issues)
* As a developer:

  You can make an issue or pull request. We are still early in the project life, so if you've got a better way to do templating (that doesn't involve a server side), or you think they layout would look better with something that effects all pages, please file an issue first so we can discuss.
