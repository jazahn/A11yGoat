## What Will We Be Doing?

 1. Downloading and using a basic browser based screen reader.
 2. Doing a tutorial for that screen reader.
 3. Working with any of the exercises on an accessibility learning site.

## Prerequisites

 * headphones
 * download [ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/) (and Chrome)

## ChromeVox Interactive Tutorial

ChromeVox is a browser based screen reader. It does not function outside of the [Chrome] browser, but 99% of the time it will function the same as a full-fledged screen reader (JAWS, VoiceOver, NVDA). What this allows is a controllable environment where you can experience the web in a way you’re not accustomed to. It can help put you in the mindset of why some of the accessibility topics are important. It’s recommended you go through the tutorial completely. But feel free to move on if you think you’ve gotten the hang of it. [Interactive Tutorial](http://www.chromevox.com/tutorial/index.html)

### Underwater / Raspy / Distorted Voice

A while ago, ChromeVox made an update which caused the default voice to sound distorted. This is fixed by going into the settings -> extensions -> ChromeVox options and change the voice.

## A11yGoat

A11yGoat is a collection of accessibility exercises to be completed at your leisure. Pick and choose which you want to work with. All of the exercises are based off of [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) rules. Each exercise has an explanation that should get you moving in the right direction with what to search for or links that take you directly to the answer. You can then work on them inline and test using ChromeVox. See what it’s like when it’s inaccessible, and then fix it and see what it’s like accessible. [A11yGoat](http://jazahn.github.io/A11yGoat/)

### Where to Start?

Look through the exercises available on [perceivable](http://jazahn.github.io/A11yGoat/perceivable.html) and [operable](http://jazahn.github.io/A11yGoat/operable.html) and if you can't decide where to start, just start with [1.1.1 on perceivable](http://jazahn.github.io/A11yGoat/perceivable.html).

### Wait, what is that 1.1.1?

The numbers in the circle refer to the WCAG 2.0 rule that they correspond to.
