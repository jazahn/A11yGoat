description: "Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such."
accessible: false
explanation: "While the burden of captioning rests *mostly* on the shoulders of the content creator, as a developer, we need to know how to deal with captions. This is a normal HTML5 video tag with a random video.\n
\n
* Take a look at [the WEBVTT file](/A11yGoat/video/developerStories-subtitles-en.vtt)\n
* [How HTML5 Captioning Works](http://www.3playmedia.com/how-it-works/how-to-guides/html5-video-captioning/)\n
* Note that the track element cannot be used from a `file://` URL. To see tracks in action, put files on a web server.\n\n

Remember that while, as developers, we cannot ensure captions exist, we can do 2 things.\n\n

1. Say something if you find yourself working on non-captioned material.\n
2. Make sure you know how to add captions."
