description: "When using the img element, specify a short text alternative with the alt attribute. Note. The value of this attribute is referred to as 'alt text'.<br><br>
When an image contains words that are important to understanding the content, the alt text should include those words. This will allow the alt text to play the same function on the page as the image. Note that it does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image."
accessible: false
explanation: "Missing alt tags. Note that the alternative text needs to convey the purpose of the data, not necessarily describing it exactly. In general, adding alt descriptions to images is very easy. But different things need to be described in different ways. \n\n

Below are 4 items\n
1. An image that contains text following it.\n
2. An image that has the text you would normally put in the `alt` under the image.\n
3. A non-image representation. This will need an [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute) and it's semantically appropriate to use an [abbr](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H28.html) tag.\n
4. An image that is functioning as the first letter of the text. And while we're at it, how do you deal with lipsum? Hint, see the example above.\n\n

'Authors MAY, with caution, use aria-hidden to hide visibly rendered content from assistive technologies only if the act of hiding this content is intended to improve the experience for users of assistive technologies by removing redundant or extraneous content.'\n\n
