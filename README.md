## How to Contribute
* As an accesisbility professional

  Please feel free to browse the public site and if you have suggestions or can think of things to add, add them via the issue tracker (https://github.com/jazahn/A11yGoat/issues)
* As a developer:

  You can make an issue or pull request. We are still early in the project life, so if you've got a better way to do templating (that doesn't involve a server side), or you think they layout would look better with something that effects all pages, please file an issue first so we can discuss.
